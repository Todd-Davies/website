> On May 20th 2025, the European Commission and the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) agreed on a competition cooperation agreement, an important milestone in the evolving relationship between the EU and the UK in competition enforcement, which became institutionally more complex as a result of Brexit. This post introduces the content of the Agreement, compares it to the pre-Brexit scenario as well as to other similar agreements that the Parties have signed, and provides an analysis.
