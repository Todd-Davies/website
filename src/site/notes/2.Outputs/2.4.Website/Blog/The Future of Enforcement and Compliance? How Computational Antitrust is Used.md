I got the chance to appear on the **[Our Curious Amalgam podcast](https://ourcuriousamalgam.com/episode/)** by the [American Bar Association's Antitrust Law group](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/antitrust_law/). It was really exciting to be on!

The hosts ([Matthew Hall](https://www.mcguirewoods.com/people/h/matthew-hall/) and [Anora Wang](https://www.arnoldporter.com/en/people/w/wang-anora)) and I had a discussion about the latest developments in computational antitrust, sparked by my previous post about the [[2.Outputs/2.4.Website/Blog/The dark side of computational antitrust\|the "dark side" of computational antitrust]]. Among other topics, we covered:

- What is computational antitrust?
- The pros and cons of its adoption by competition authorities (where I caution about the hidden costs of enforcement).
- The emergence of new AI-powered tools which can help companies "comply" with competition law (or do they help companies evade the law by limiting the production of evidence?).
- What competition authorities might do to response.
