> Why does Google hold a dominant position in AdTech? This blog post, summarising my [paper in Utrecht Law Review](https://utrechtlawreview.org/articles/10.36633/ulr.1113), examines why and proposes a novel remedy which would entail Google divesting its AdTech stack and permitting consumers to choose which advertising network monetises their useage of its online platforms.
