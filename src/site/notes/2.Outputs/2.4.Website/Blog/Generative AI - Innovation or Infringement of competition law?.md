 I'm featured on the [Shaping Competition in the Digital Age podcast](https://scidaproject.com/scida-podcasts/#:~:text=Episode%204-%20Todd%20Davies) ([Spotify link](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7H8by0DyCeCCpJVj8qkqCC)) with Anush Ganesh and Kena Zheng. 

 > The conversation is about, among other things, how I got into competition law from being a software engineer, how there really is no excuse for dominant undertakings designing internet platforms to be anti-competitive, and the need for conceptual clarity in competition law. The content of the episode draws from my preprint about [Gen AI & Article 102 TFEU](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5375544).
