> I discuss the emergence of AI powered tooling which proof-read emails before they are sent and flag content which could later be used as evidence in competition law cases. I argue that the use of AI in this manner could harm competition enforcement efforts, but that it doesn't have to be that way. AI could be used in a manner commensurate with both the public and private interest. Of course, regulation or guidance from competition authorities might be required to make that a reality.
