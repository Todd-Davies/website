I used to post my school/university notes on here. I no longer do because most of them are horrifically out of date. If you're interested, you're welcome to look directly at the Git repos, which have the compiled pdf files in them.

- [B.Sc Computer Science Year 2](https://github.com/Todd-Davies/second-year-notes)
- [B.Sc Computer Science Year 1](https://github.com/Todd-Davies/first-year-notes)
- [A-level](https://github.com/Todd-Davies/A-Level-Notes)
- [GCSE](https://github.com/Todd-Davies/GCSE-Notes)

FYI posting my notes online was probably the most rewarding and useful thing I did during my bachelor's degree. If you're considering it, I strongly recommend it. If you have any questions, feel free to [email me](mailto:todd@todddavi.es).
