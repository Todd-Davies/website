> On May 20th 2025, the European Commission and the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) agreed on a competition cooperation agreement, an important milestone in the evolving relationship between the EU and the UK in competition enforcement, which became institutionally more complex as a result of Brexit.
