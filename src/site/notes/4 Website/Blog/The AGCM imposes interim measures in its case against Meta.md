> Meta’s decision to actively interfere with the ability of rivals to compete on its dominant platform constitutes a refusal to deal under the Android Auto doctrine. This fact did not escape notice of the Italian Competition Authority. On the 25th of November 2025, the Authority announced that it had “expanded [its] investigation procedure” against Meta to include the aforementioned WhatsApp Business Solution Terms. More importantly, the AGCM also decided to initiate “the procedure for the adoption [of] precautionary measures”, i.e. interim measures, regarding Meta’s integration of its AI assistant into WhatsApp and its updated Terms.
