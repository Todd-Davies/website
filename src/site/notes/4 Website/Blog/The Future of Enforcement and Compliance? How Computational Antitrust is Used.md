I got the chance to appear on the [Our Curious Amalgam podcast](https://ourcuriousamalgam.com/episode/) by the [American Bar Association's Antitrust Law group](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/antitrust_law/) to talk in more depth about my post about the [[4 Website/Blog/The dark side of computational antitrust\|the "dark side" of computational antitrust]]. During the conversation, the hosts ([Matthew Hall](https://www.mcguirewoods.com/people/h/matthew-hall/) and [Anora Wang](https://www.arnoldporter.com/en/people/w/wang-anora)) and I discussed:

- What computational antitrust is.
- The pros and cons of its adoption by competition authorities (where I caution about the hidden costs of enforcement).
- The emergence of new AI-powered tools which can help companies "comply" with competition law (or do they help companies evade the law by limiting the production of evidence?).
- What competition authorities might do to response.
