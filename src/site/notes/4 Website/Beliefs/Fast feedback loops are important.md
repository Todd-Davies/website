It's important to do things quickly because you can receive feedback on your actions faster and adjust your approach accordingly. Tight feedback loops mean that "[you make contact with reality more frequently](https://nat.org/)". You learn faster that way because learning always occurs through feedback. In turn, you get to where you want to be faster.

Speed is especially important when the world is changing around you. If you're too slow, your outputs will be obsolete by the time you're finished with them. You'll end up wasting time.

Examples of this in practice:
- Sending out an early draft of your writing (or testing the waters with a tweet/blog post before embarking on a big writing project)
- Relatedly, having an "[MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product)" ready as soon as possible
- The idea that [quantity leads to quality](https://austinkleon.com/2020/12/10/quantity-leads-to-quality-the-origin-of-a-parable/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), because you get lots of 
- Decision makers are more agile (and hence more effective) when they run a fast [OODA loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop) (observe, orient, decide, act).

Counterexamples of this in practice:
- [The Beer Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_distribution_game) (information propagating slowly causes chaos)
