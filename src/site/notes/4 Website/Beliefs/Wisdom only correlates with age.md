Wisdom is distilled learning. We need to a lot of learning to be wise. Learning comes from experience. It is often assumed that experience comes with age, but that's not quite true. Experience, and ultimately wisdom, only *correlates* with age. 

Why? Because it's possible to live essentially the same day/month/year many times. Many people do. This is one reason why repetitive times in our lives, months revising for exams or years trapped in a boring job, feel like a blur. We just lived the same day over and over again.

Seneca makes essentially the same point in *[On the Shortness of Life](https://dn790008.ca.archive.org/0/items/SenecaOnTheShortnessOfLife/Seneca%20on%20the%20Shortness%20of%20Life.pdf)*:

> So you must not think a man has lived long because he has white hair and wrinkles: he has not lived long, just existed long. For suppose you should think that a man had had a long voyage who had been caught in a ranging storm as he left harbour, and carried hither and thither and driven round and round in a circle by the rage of opposing winds? He did not have a long voyage, just a long tossing about.

Thus, while [[4 Website/Beliefs/Fast feedback loops are important\|fast feedback loops are important]], varied feedback loops are important too. If we try the same thing over and over again, we should expect to receive broadly the same results.^[Of course, assuming a reasonable degree of determinism.] We're unlikely to learn something new that way. As such, to become wise, we should also aim to get a wide variety of life experience. 

The [Pareto principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) also comes to mind. It's likely (although I have no proof) that 80% of our wisdom comes from 20% of our experiences. But which ones? Surely it's *new* experiences that are likely to teach us something, not repeated ones. Move countries, change careers, cook a dish from a new cuisine, study something completely new. 

Lastly, it's worth pointing out that if we want to learn and become wise, then we also have to pay attention. Exposure to an experience is not the same as having an experience. There's no little point visiting a new country if you spend the whole time reading in your hotel room (or worse, on social media). To learn from experiences, we must be "present" enough to actually live them.^[I've found that regular meditation helps a lot with this.]
