I’m a final year PhD candidate in Competition Law at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/laws/), supervised by [Ioannis Lianos](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/1800-ioannis-lianos), [Deni Mantzari](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/24171-despoina-mantzari) and [David Murrell](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/604-david-murrell).

My research asks how dominant companies harm the effective structure of competition. Drawing on theoretical ecology, it challenges the conventional approach to competition enforcement by proposing a new ontology of competition. In doing so, it provides a fresh interpretation of exclusionary abuse of dominance under Article 102 TFEU.

Alongside my PhD, I work on a variety of topics related to EU competition law and digital market regulation. You can find my publications [[4 Website/Publications\|here]]. I also serve as a graduate lecturer at the [UCL Faculty of Laws](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/laws/ucl-faculty-laws).

I hold a master’s degree in [Politics and Technology](https://www.tum.de/en/studies/degree-programs/detail/politics-technology-master-of-science-msc) from the [Technical University Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/) and a bachelor’s degree in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/) from [The University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk). I previously worked for six years as a software engineer at [Google](https://google.com), mostly in the security and privacy space.

Outside of that, I’m interested in all sorts of things. When not writing my thesis, you will likely find me biking around London, cold swimming, thrift shopping, meditating, hosting, or travelling somewhere around Europe. Here is a [[4 Website/Beliefs\|list of things I believe]].

I blog somewhat regularly. But not (usually) here. Instead, I like to write in various places across the internet. This page collates various posts into one place.
